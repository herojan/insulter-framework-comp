# Exercising The Services
## Functional Tests
To ensure fairness, there will be a suite of functional tests defined to exercise the
service. Will probably use BDD style specifications to make it easy to understand the
requirements in case anyone wants to add in a new framework via PR... :tumbleweed:

## Performance Tests
There will also be a suite of perf tests that will put some load on the service to 
check memory and cpu under load.
