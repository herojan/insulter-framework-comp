# Framework Comparison Repo
Intentions for this repo are to have a simple CRUD service built to a mimum set of requirements in a few different frameworks / languages and to have the ability to run a comparison of the deliverables in terms of deployment performance. To try and keep things as consistant as possible, the build artifacts for each of the implementations should be a docker image.
